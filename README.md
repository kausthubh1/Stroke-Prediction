# Stroke-Prediction

we have experimented with Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree and Random Forest methods to learn and analyze the prediction of stroke. To achieve this, we have considered a stroke dataset. In addition, We have also presented the results acquired from multiple methods/algorithms and determined the best algorithm to use to predict the occurrence of stroke.
